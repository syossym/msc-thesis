	by light into mechanical oscillator (one of the Fabry-Perot (FP)
	resonator mirrors is the mechanical resonator). Pumping FP resonator,
	by light detuned from resonance one can create the positive or negative
	rigidity in mechanical oscillator. Such a rigidity being introduced
	with delay (of the order of relaxation time of FP resonator) is equivalent
	to additional low noise damping. We propose to introduce this damping
	to tranquilize (to depress) parametric oscillatory instability in
	FP interferometer (Phys. Lett. A 287 (2001) 331) which is undesirable
	in laser gravitational wave antennae.},
