For incoherent excitation conditions, the theory is used to describe nonlinear excitonic emission properties of single-quantum wells, optically coupled multiple quantum-well systems, and quantum wells in a microcavity. Resonant coherent optical excitation leads to a direct coupling between the induced coherent polarization and photoluminescence. The resulting quantum corrections to the semiclassical semiconductor Bloch equations and the coherent contributions to the semiconductor luminescence equations are discussed. The secondary emission in directions deviating from the coherent excitation direction after femtosecond-pulse excitation is studied. Coherent control and quadrature squeezing for the light emission are analyzed.},

The resulting normal-mode splitting of the optical resonance is observed in reflection, transmission, and luminescence experiments. In the nonlinear regime the strong light-matter coupling influences the excitation-dependent bleaching of the normal-mode resonances for nonresonant excitation, leads to transient saturation and normal-mode oscillations for resonant pulsed excitation and is responsible for the density-dependent signatures in the luminescence characteristics. These and many more experimental observations are summarized and explained in this review using a microscopic theory for the Coulomb interacting electron-hole system in the quantum well that is nonperturbatively coupled to the cavity light field.},

Only if the symmetry of the strained crystal is accounted for in all terms of the Hamiltonian, a consistent definition and calculation of the momentum matrix becomes possible. The band structure and wave functions are nonanalytical functions of strain and crystal momentum. For strained crystals, the extrapolation from the Γ point into the Brillouin zone, such as the effective-mass approximation for the optical-matrix elements, can be misleading. For certain cases, the heavy- and light-hole isoenergetic surfaces form complex figures resembling the indicatrix of birefringent biaxial crystals. The symmetry of the hole wave functions causes dichroism for photon energies close to the gap energy, while the crystal becomes optically isotropic for larger photon energies. Numerical results are presented for the eight-band k⋅p model of biaxially strained bulklike {1.3-μm–InxGa1-xAsyP1-y} on {InP} being an important material in optoelectronics.},

For a Ga mole fraction x less than 0.468 (compression), the top subband is heavy-hole-like.

The mapping eliminates all nonlocal effects and long-range Gibbs oscillations in the Burt theory, producing an infinite-order differential equation in which interface effects are strongly localized to the immediate vicinity of the interface. A general procedure is given for obtaining finite-order boundary conditions from the infinite-order equation; the second-order theory reduces to the {BenDaniel-Duke} model with a δ-function potential at the interface.

Focusing on direct band gap zinc-blende heterostructures, we derive criteria that must be fulfilled by the input parameters in order to establish ellipticity. Using these criteria, we compare symmetrized operators with {Burt-Foreman} {[B.} A. Foreman, Phys. Rev. B 56, R12748 (1997)] operator ordering. We substantiate our arguments with numerical results obtained using linear finite elements. We find that the space of stable input parameters is very narrow and demonstrate that {Burt-Foreman} operator ordering together with experimental k∙p input parameters leads to near-elliptic envelope equations in the 4×4 and 6×6 models, whereas symmetrization yields strong nonellipticity. In the k∙p 8×8 model, the procedure of renormalizing parameters of the 4×4 model generally yields parameters producing spurious solutions, even for {Burt-Foreman} operator ordering. We find that this problem can be resolved by using a smaller optical matrix parameter Ep. This suggests that the parametrization of k∙p models for heterostructures of any dimensionality must be reviewed, checking against the mathematical ellipticity of the equation system.},

	abstract = {The increasing sophistication used in the fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures and in the experiments performed on them requires more sophisticated theoretical techniques than previously employed. The philosophy behind the author's exact envelope function representation method is clarified and contrasted with that of the conventional method. The significance of globally slowly varying envelope functions is explained. The difference between the envelope functions that appear in the author's envelope function representation and conventional envelope functions is highlighted and some erroneous statements made in the literature on the scope of envelope function methods are corrected. A perceived conflict between the standard effective mass Hamiltonian and the uncertainty principle is resolved demonstrating the limited usefulness of this principle in determining effective Hamiltonians. A simple example showing how to obtain correct operator ordering in electronic valence band Hamiltonians is worked out in detailed tutorial style. It is shown how the use of out of zone solutions to the author's approximate envelope function equations plays an essential role in their mathematically rigorous solution. In particular, a demonstration is given of the calculation of an approximate wavefunction for an electronic state in a one dimensional nanostructure with abrupt interfaces and disparate crystals using out of zone solutions alone. The author's work on the interband dipole matrix element for slowly varying envelope functions is extended to envelope functions without restriction. Exact envelope function equations are derived for multicomponent fields to emphasize that the author's method is a general one for converting a microscopic description to a mesoscopic one, applicable to linear partial differential equations with piecewise or approximately piecewise periodic coefficients. As an example, the method is applied to the derivation of approximate envelope function equations from the Maxwell equations for photonic nanostructures.},

Only if the symmetry of the strained crystal is accounted for in all terms of the Hamiltonian, a consistent definition and calculation of the momentum matrix becomes possible. The band structure and wave functions are nonanalytical functions of strain and crystal momentum. For strained crystals, the extrapolation from the Γ point into the Brillouin zone, such as the effective-mass approximation for the optical-matrix elements, can be misleading. For certain cases, the heavy- and light-hole isoenergetic surfaces form complex figures resembling the indicatrix of birefringent biaxial crystals. The symmetry of the hole wave functions causes dichroism for photon energies close to the gap energy, while the crystal becomes optically isotropic for larger photon energies. Numerical results are presented for the eight-band k⋅p model of biaxially strained bulklike {1.3-μm–InxGa1-xAsyP1-y} on {InP} being an important material in optoelectronics.},

The resulting normal-mode splitting of the optical resonance is observed in reflection, transmission, and luminescence experiments. In the nonlinear regime the strong light-matter coupling influences the excitation-dependent bleaching of the normal-mode resonances for nonresonant excitation, leads to transient saturation and normal-mode oscillations for resonant pulsed excitation and is responsible for the density-dependent signatures in the luminescence characteristics. These and many more experimental observations are summarized and explained in this review using a microscopic theory for the Coulomb interacting electron-hole system in the quantum well that is nonperturbatively coupled to the cavity light field.},

In particular the model of two coupled harmonic oscillators for the dispersion is shown to hold in the whole range of coupling constant and mirror reflectivity values. The theory describes at the same time the weak coupling regime, where an enhanced spontaneous emission takes place, and the strong coupling regime where instead a Rabi splitting in the dispersion can be observed. Existing experimental results are described with great accuracy. Analytical expressions for the splittings in reflectivity, transmission, absorption, and photoluminescence are given.

This is a relatively new field with most important developments having occurred in the last 5 years. We describe how such microcavities enable both electronic and photonic properties of semiconductors, and the interaction between them, to be controlled in the same structure. The resulting coupled exciton-photon eigenstates, cavity polaritons, have many interesting properties including very low mass for small in-plane wavevectors, and can be studied easily and directly in optical experiments, unlike exciton-polaritons in bulk semiconductors. A wealth of new optical phenomena has been reported in this field in the last few years. This review describes the most important of these phenomena. We discuss the reasons why polaritons have fundamentally different properties in microcavities as compared with those in bulk materials or quantum wells. We explain the factors which control the strength of the exciton-photon coupling and how the resulting optical spectra can be modelled. We then emphasize, in the main body of the review, the particularly important results of reflectivity experiments at both normal and oblique angles of incidence, the effects of external electric and magnetic fields, the results of coherent Raman scattering experiments, the effects of disorder on microcavity spectra, including the observation of motional narrowing over the exciton disorder potential, studies of coupled microcavities, and photoluminescence and time-resolved phenomena.},

The theory combines a unified description of electron and hole states with only five adjustable parameters for each material constituting the quantum well. Unlike earlier k⋅p work it fully accounts for the coupling between the lowest electron, the light-hole, the heavy-hole, and the spin-orbit split-off hole bands and the coupling to all other bands is taken into account perturbatively. The theory thereby also applies to quantum wells where the spin-orbit splitting is comparable to the hole-confinement potential energies. The full inclusion of the k? dependence of confinement energies and electron-hole transition strengths allows for accurate predictions of excitation spectra of quantum wells. In this respect the results of our simple k⋅p theory stand comparison to the results of the more complicated tight-binding theory of Chang and Schulman. Our theory can thus explain the recently observed Δn≠0 transitions. As a final application we have calculated gain spectra of quantum-well lasers.},

The conductance for an abrupt {GaAs} p-n tunnel diode is calculated and shown to exhibit minima near zero bias for highly asymmetrical doping ratios. The conductance of metal-oxide-semimetal {(M-O-SM)} tunnel junctions is evaluated both with and without the inclusion of space-charge effects and of surface states. All calculations are performed using solvable models for which the {WKBJ} approximation is not imposed. Neither the removal of the {WKBJ} approximation nor the space-charge effects give rise to maxima in the conductance of the {M-O-SM} junctions near a band edge.},

	abstract = {A direct general method for deriving effective-mass equations for microstructures with atomically abrupt boundaries is presented. The principal assumption is that the envelope functions are slowly varying on the scale of the lattice period. The band-edge Bloch functions are not assumed to be the same on both sides of an interface and it is shown how the differences can be taken into account perturbatively. The particle in a box method is known to work well in many situations. To demonstrate why, a derivation of the effective-mass equation is carried out explicitly for the case of conduction-band states of a {type-I} microstructure composed of zinc-blende crystals without spin-orbit interaction. The derivation provides much insight into why the effective-mass method works so well. The method is illustrated by applying it to a one-dimensional superlattice problem. For this model problem, the effective-mass approximation to the wave function is seen to be good even for a quantum well one lattice period wide.},
