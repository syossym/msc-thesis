The interface is treated nonperturbatively, and our approach is applicable to mismatched heterostructure. We obtain the interface connection rules for the multiband envelope function and the multiband heterostructure Hamiltonian from the k∙p version of the variational principle. The k∙p heterostructure Hamiltonian contains the short-range interface terms which consist of two physically distinct contributions. The first one depends only on the structure of the interface, and the second one is completely determined by the bulk parameters. We discover new structure inversion asymmetry terms and new magnetic energy terms important in spintronic applications.},

A new envelope-function method, developed by the author over the past few years, is reviewed. This new method is based on both a generalization and a novel application to microstructures of the Luttinger-Kohn envelope-function expansion. The differences between this new method and the conventional envelope-function method are emphasized. An alternative derivation of the new envelope-function equations, which are exact, to that already published is provided. A new and improved derivation of the author's effective-mass equation is given, in which the differences in the zone-centre eigenstates of the constituent crystals are taken into account.

abstract = {A direct general method for deriving effective-mass equations for microstructures with atomically abrupt boundaries is presented. The principal assumption is that the envelope functions are slowly varying on the scale of the lattice period. The band-edge Bloch functions are not assumed to be the same on both sides of an interface and it is shown how the differences can be taken into account perturbatively. The particle in a box method is known to work well in many situations. To demonstrate why, a derivation of the effective-mass equation is carried out explicitly for the case of conduction-band states of a type-I microstructure composed of zinc-blende crystals without spin-orbit interaction. The derivation provides much insight into why the effective-mass method works so well. The method is illustrated by applying it to a one-dimensional superlattice problem. For this model problem, the effective-mass approximation to the wave function is seen to be good even for a quantum well one lattice period wide.},

abstract = {The increasing sophistication used in the fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures and in the experiments performed on them requires more sophisticated theoretical techniques than previously employed. The philosophy behind the author's exact envelope function representation method is clarified and contrasted with that of the conventional method. The significance of globally slowly varying envelope functions is explained. The difference between the envelope functions that appear in the author's envelope function representation and conventional envelope functions is highlighted and some erroneous statements made in the literature on the scope of envelope function methods are corrected. A perceived conflict between the standard effective mass Hamiltonian and the uncertainty principle is resolved demonstrating the limited usefulness of this principle in determining effective Hamiltonians. A simple example showing how to obtain correct operator ordering in electronic valence band Hamiltonians is worked out in detailed tutorial style. It is shown how the use of out of zone solutions to the author's approximate envelope function equations plays an essential role in their mathematically rigorous solution. In particular, a demonstration is given of the calculation of an approximate wavefunction for an electronic state in a one dimensional nanostructure with abrupt interfaces and disparate crystals using out of zone solutions alone. The author's work on the interband dipole matrix element for slowly varying envelope functions is extended to envelope functions without restriction. Exact envelope function equations are derived for multicomponent fields to emphasize that the author's method is a general one for converting a microscopic description to a mesoscopic one, applicable to linear partial differential equations with piecewise or approximately piecewise periodic coefficients. As an example, the method is applied to the derivation of approximate envelope function equations from the Maxwell equations for photonic nanostructures.},

This equation is exactly equivalent to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, and is obtained by applying a k-space transformation of variables to the Burt envelope-function theory in which the Brillouin zone is mapped onto the infinite real axis. The mapping eliminates all nonlocal effects and long-range Gibbs oscillations in the Burt theory, producing an infinite-order differential equation in which interface effects are strongly localized to the immediate vicinity of the interface. A general procedure is given for obtaining finite-order boundary conditions from the infinite-order equation; the second-order theory reduces to the BenDaniel-Duke model with a $\delta$-function potential at the interface. The derivation is presented for a simple one-dimensional crystal but can easily be generalized for more complex situations.},

The results obtained with the two treatments are proved to be equivalent. Simple analytical expressions for the exciton-radiation mixed mode energies are obtained. In particular the model of two coupled harmonic oscillators for the dispersion is shown to hold in the whole range of coupling constant and mirror reflectivity values. The theory describes at the same time the weak coupling regime, where an enhanced spontaneous emission takes place, and the strong coupling regime where instead a Rabi splitting in the dispersion can be observed. Existing experimental results are described with great accuracy. Analytical expressions for the splittings in reflectivity, transmission, absorption, and photoluminescence are given. The splittings are all different from each other, and the differences could be observed in structures with suitably chosen parameters.},

abstract = {The physics of strong coupling phenomena in semiconductor quantum microcavities is reviewed. This is a relatively new field with most important developments having occurred in the last 5 years. We describe how such microcavities enable both electronic and photonic properties of semiconductors, and the interaction between them, to be controlled in the same structure. The resulting coupled exciton-photon eigenstates, cavity polaritons, have many interesting properties including very low mass for small in-plane wavevectors, and can be studied easily and directly in optical experiments, unlike exciton-polaritons in bulk semiconductors. A wealth of new optical phenomena has been reported in this field in the last few years. This review describes the most important of these phenomena. We discuss the reasons why polaritons have fundamentally different properties in microcavities as compared with those in bulk materials or quantum wells. We explain the factors which control the strength of the exciton-photon coupling and how the resulting optical spectra can be modelled. We then emphasize, in the main body of the review, the particularly important results of reflectivity experiments at both normal and oblique angles of incidence, the effects of external electric and magnetic fields, the results of coherent Raman scattering experiments, the effects of disorder on microcavity spectra, including the observation of motional narrowing over the exciton disorder potential, studies of coupled microcavities, and photoluminescence and time-resolved phenomena.},

abstract = {Valence subbands of uniaxially stressed GaAs-Ga1-xAlxAs quantum wells are found by solving exactly the multiband effective-mass equation for the envelope function; as in the particle in a box problem, we first solve the effective-mass equation in each bulk material, and then we impose boundary conditions on the linear combinations of bulk solutions. Discrete symmetries of the effective-mass Hamiltonian are used to decouple the spin-degenerate subbands; the energy levels are obtained as the zeros of an 8×8 determinant. The functional form of the wave functions is given analytically, and is used in order to discuss the heavy-hole–light-hole mixing at finite values of the in-plane vector k?; the mixing greatly increases when the applied stress reduces the energy separation at k?=0. Resonances are shown to arise and are due to the degeneracy of discrete levels with states of the continuum at different values of k?.},

For GaAs-GaAlAs materials, the envelope functions are the solutions of an effective Hamiltonian in which both band edges and effective masses are position dependent. The effective-mass jumps modify the boundary conditions which are imposed to the eigenstates of the effective-mass Hamiltonian. In InAs-GaSb superlattices, the dispersion relations, although quite similar to those obtained in GaAs-GaAlAs materials, reflect the genuine symmetry mismatch of InAs (electrons) and GaSb (light-holes) levels. The evolution of the InAs-GaSb band structure with increasing periodicity is calculated and found to be in excellent agreement with previous LCAO results.

The resulting normal-mode splitting of the optical resonance is observed in reflection, transmission, and luminescence experiments. In the nonlinear regime the strong light-matter coupling influences the excitation-dependent bleaching of the normal-mode resonances for nonresonant excitation, leads to transient saturation and normal-mode oscillations for resonant pulsed excitation and is responsible for the density-dependent signatures in the luminescence characteristics. These and many more experimental observations are summarized and explained in this review using a microscopic theory for the Coulomb interacting electron-hole system in the quantum well that is nonperturbatively coupled to the cavity light field.},

The valence band is quite similar to germanium.

Focusing on direct band gap zinc-blende heterostructures, we derive criteria that must be fulfilled by the input parameters in order to establish ellipticity. Using these criteria, we compare symmetrized operators with \{Burt-Foreman\} \{[B.\} A. Foreman, Phys. Rev. B 56, R12748 (1997)] operator ordering. We substantiate our arguments with numerical results obtained using linear finite elements. We find that the space of stable input parameters is very narrow and demonstrate that \{Burt-Foreman\} operator ordering together with experimental k∙p input parameters leads to near-elliptic envelope equations in the 4×4 and 6×6 models, whereas symmetrization yields strong nonellipticity. In the k∙p 8×8 model, the procedure of renormalizing parameters of the 4×4 model generally yields parameters producing spurious solutions, even for \{Burt-Foreman\} operator ordering. We find that this problem can be resolved by using a smaller optical matrix parameter Ep. This suggests that the parametrization of k∙p models for heterostructures of any dimensionality must be reviewed, checking against the mathematical ellipticity of the equation system.},

Unlike earlier k⋅p work it fully accounts for the coupling between the lowest electron, the light-hole, the heavy-hole, and the spin-orbit split-off hole bands and the coupling to all other bands is taken into account perturbatively. The theory thereby also applies to quantum wells where the spin-orbit splitting is comparable to the hole-confinement potential energies. The full inclusion of the k? dependence of confinement energies and electron-hole transition strengths allows for accurate predictions of excitation spectra of quantum wells. In this respect the results of our simple k⋅p theory stand comparison to the results of the more complicated tight-binding theory of Chang and Schulman. Our theory can thus explain the recently observed $\Delta$n≠0 transitions. As a final application we have calculated gain spectra of quantum-well lasers.},

Only if the symmetry of the strained crystal is accounted for in all terms of the Hamiltonian, a consistent definition and calculation of the momentum matrix becomes possible. The band structure and wave functions are nonanalytical functions of strain and crystal momentum. For strained crystals, the extrapolation from the $\Gamma$ point into the Brillouin zone, such as the effective-mass approximation for the optical-matrix elements, can be misleading. For certain cases, the heavy- and light-hole isoenergetic surfaces form complex figures resembling the indicatrix of birefringent biaxial crystals. The symmetry of the hole wave functions causes dichroism for photon energies close to the gap energy, while the crystal becomes optically isotropic for larger photon energies. Numerical results are presented for the eight-band k⋅p model of biaxially strained bulklike \{1.3-$\mu$m–InxGa1-xAsyP1-y\} on \{InP\} being an important material in optoelectronics.},

For incoherent excitation conditions, the theory is used to describe nonlinear excitonic emission properties of single-quantum wells, optically coupled multiple quantum-well systems, and quantum wells in a microcavity. Resonant coherent optical excitation leads to a direct coupling between the induced coherent polarization and photoluminescence. The resulting quantum corrections to the semiclassical semiconductor Bloch equations and the coherent contributions to the semiconductor luminescence equations are discussed. The secondary emission in directions deviating from the coherent excitation direction after femtosecond-pulse excitation is studied. Coherent control and quadrature squeezing for the light emission are analyzed.},

@article{martin_theory_1959,
abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers dealing with many-particle systems from a unified, nonperturbative point of view. It contains derivations and discussions of various field-theoretical techniques which will be applied in subsequent papers. In a short introduction the general method of approach is summarized, and its relationship to other field-theoretic problems indicated. In the second section the macroscopic properties of the spectra of many-particle systems are described. Asymptotic evaluations are performed which characterize these macroscopic features in terms of intensive parameters, and the relationship of these parameters to thermodynamics is discussed. The special characteristics of the ground state are shown to follow as a limiting case of the asymptotic evaluations. The third section is devoted to the time-dependent field correlation functions, or Green's functions, which describe the microscopic behavior of a multiparticle system. These functions are defined, and related to intensive macroscopic variables when the energy and number of particles are large. Spectral representations and other properties of various one-particle Green's functions are derived. In the fourth section the treatment of non-equilibrium processes is considered. As a particular example, the electromagnetic properties of a system are expressed in terms of the special two-particle Green's function which describes current correlation. The discussion yields specifically a fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a sum rule for conductivity, and certain dispersion relations. The fifth section deals with the differential equations which determine the Green's functions. The boundary conditions that characterize the Green's function equations are exhibited without reference to adiabatic decoupling. A method for solving the equations approximately, by treating the correlations among successively larger numbers of particles, is considered. The first approximation in this sequence is shown to yield a generalized Hartree-like equation. A related, but rigorous, identity for the single-particle Green's function is then derived. A second approximation, which takes certain two-particle correlations into account, is shown to produce various additional effects: The interaction between particles is altered in a manner characterized by the intensive macroscopic parameters, and the modification and spread of the energy-momentum relation come into play. In the final section compact formal expressions for the Green's functions and other physical quantities are derived. Alternative equations and systematic approximations for the Green's functions are obtained.},

@article{ehrenreich_self-consistent_1959,
abstract = {The self-consistent field method in which a many-electron system is described by a time-dependent interaction of a single electron with a self-consistent electromagnetic field is shown to be equivalent for many purposes to the treatment given by Sawada and Brout. Starting with the correct many-electron Hamiltonian, it is found, when the approximations characteristic of the \{Sawada-Brout\} scheme are made, that the equation of motion for the pair creation operators is the same as that for the one-particle density matrix in the self-consistent field framework. These approximations are seen to correspond to (1) factorization of the two-particle density matrix, and (2) linearization with respect to off-diagonal components of the one-particle density matrix. The complex, frequency-dependent dielectric constant is obtained straight-forwardly from the self-consistent field approach both for a free-electron gas and a real solid. It is found to be the same as that obtained by Nozi\'{e}res and Pines in the random phase approximation. The resulting plasma dispersion relation for the solid in the limit of long wavelengths is discussed.},

@misc{_nsm_????,
abstract = {These electronic archive contains frequently needed information for the most important Semiconductor Materials. We have also included basic references where one can find additional information if required. In compiling this information, we took advantage of generous help from many colleagues at the \{A.F.Ioffe\} Institute who made many excellent suggestions, and, in some cases, provided us with more accurate values of material parameters. The Auger recombination coefficients for semiconductor heterostructures are developed and computed by George Zegrya, Natalia Gunko and Anatolii Polkovnikov. The archive is under construction and in this version we present only a part of the data we have computed. We plan to place more data in the archive later.
