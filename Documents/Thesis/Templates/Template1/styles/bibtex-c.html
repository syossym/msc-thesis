  .bst files

Bibliography style files define the style of a bibliography source list.

One specifies a /bibliography style/ in one's /LaTeX/ document with a line

    \bibliographystyle{/style/} 

where /style/ is the name of a .bst file (like one of those listed in
the tables below) ... /but *without* the/ .bst /extension,/ e.g. the way
to specify the author's favourite bibliography style is by

    \bibliographystyle{uwa} 

The standard bibliography styles are plain, unsrt, abbrv and alpha.
A locally produced bibliography style is: uwa. It is most like abbrv.


    .bst files on our system

The most important .bst files on our system are tabulated below

.bst file 	Style description
abbrv.bst <../bibtex/bst/base/abbrv.bst> 	Like plain.bst, except that
entries are more compact because first names, month names and journal
names are abbreviated
alpha.bst <../bibtex/bst/base/alpha.bst> 	Like plain.bst, except that
entry labels like `Knu66', formed from the author's name and the year of
publication, are used.
plain.bst <../bibtex/bst/base/plain.bst> 	This style is formatted more
or less as suggested by Mary-Claire van Leunen in /A Handbook for
Scholars / (Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1979). Entries are sorted
alphabetically and are labelled with numbers.
