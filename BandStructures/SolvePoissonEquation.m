function QStruct = SolvePoissonEquation(QStruct, Cond, Valence, params)
%
% This function solves the Poisson equation and finds the potential change
% due to the doping in strucure.
%
%   Input: 'QStruct' - the simulated quantum structure.
%          'Cond', 'Valence' - the conduction and valence band energies and
%                              wavefunctions.
%          'params' - additional simulation parameters.
%
%   Output: 'QStruct' - the new structure parameters with the augmented
%                       potentials because of the doping.
